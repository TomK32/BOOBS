          BOOBS, not boobs, is the name of the secret uptopian organization you've created.
          Honestly we don't know what BOOBS actually stands for, you never told us.

          Hello Devi, this is the
          %interact{with: 'BOOBS'} BOOBS
          secrect Moon base.
        %action{id: 'Who are you?'}
          I'm Professor Angelica Miller, formerly a NASA rocket science.
          But that's all become a bit redundent once you have a teleporter.
          Now I'm head scientist up here.
        %action{id: 'Why am I here?'}
          %p
            You are here because years ago you had this place created by
            robots using the teleporter you invented. But tragically you
            lost your memory on one of your trips home and it took us quite
            some while to find you again. Your recent sex-change didn't
            make our search easier.
          %p
            Don't worry, your memory will come back to you.

          I won't teleport goats but everything else is just fine 

      %page#intro
        %p
          Welcome to the alternative reality where a secret organization of hackers,
          scientists, and utopists have invented a teleporter and decided to build a
          operational base on the moon, waiting for their time to change the world.

          %turn{to: 'moonbase'} Go on, start the story.
          

      %page#moonbase
        %p
          You've just been teleported from Earth into the base's big Hall and a
          %interact{with: 'miller'} woman dressed in a white coat
          is ushering you off the teleporter platform.

        %p
          The Hall has a huge glass ceiling showing nothing but blackness and stars,
          you can also see a slender tower, a lookout aparently and reachable by a
          %turn{to: 'lookout'} spiral staircase.

      %page#lookout
        %img.right{src: 'images/lookout.jpg'}
        You can see the Earth sneaking over the moon's horizon, all you see of Earth
        is a part of the Pacific Ocean.

        %p
          %turn{to: 'moonbase'} Return to the Hall
