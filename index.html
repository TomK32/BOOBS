          B.O.O.B.S., not boobs, is the name of the secret uptopian organization you've created.
          Honestly we don't know what BorrOBS actually stands for, you never told us.

          I'm Professor Angelica Miller, formerly a NASA rocket science.
          But that's all become a bit redundent once you have a teleporter.
          Now I'm head scientist up here.

        <action id='Why am I here?'>
          <p>
            You are here because years ago you had this place created by
            robots using the teleporter you invented. But tragically you
            lost your memory on one of your trips home and it took us quite
            some while to find you again. And your sex-change before you lost your memory
            didn't make our search easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't worry, your memory will come back to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meanwhile take this teleporter bracelet and go to Commander Kaur in the mission control.

          Welcome to the alternative reality where a secret organization of hackers,
          scientists, and utopists have invented a teleporter and decided to build a
          operational base on the moon, waiting for their time to change the world.

          You've just been teleported from Earth into the moonbase's big Hall and a
          <interact with='miller'>woman dressed in a white coat</interact>
          is ushering you off the teleporter platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hall has a huge glass ceiling showing nothing but blackness and stars,
          you can also see a slender tower, a lookout aparently and reachable by a
          <turn to='lookout'>spiral staircase.</turn>
          On the far end you see a sort of

          A large grid of displays depicts the earth with a few circles

            In order for a safe teleport we need to land in a room that is most likely empty.
            That's the reason why we won't teleport directly into Manning's cell but outside of it.
            We'll have to crack the lock but Private Roldóttir is an expert for that.

          Your second ever, well, as far as you can remember, teleport felt a lot easier
          than the last one. Perhaps it's just using the teleporter pads instead of the
          bracelet that makes the jumps feel more comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are in a darkish, narrow corridor. You landed at what you consider the far end
          of the corridor, right in front of a door. Cmd Kaur knocks on the door and from
          inside the distinct but faint voice of Chelsa Manning asks who's there.
          <em>Yup, that's the right one. Hello Chelsea Manning, we're here to get you out.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Private Roldóttir is already having a look at the electronic lock.
          <em>
            Commander, there's a little problem, it's not the lock I expected.
            They installed an additional electronic lock, specifically for male prisons,
            the only lock on the planet that's doing super fast genetic tests.
            Originally designed for Mormon households, adapted by a few states
            to decrease bribery and prostitution in county prisons...
          </em>
          <em>
            Oh I see, I'm boring you with details.
            In short: We need someone with XY chromosoms to open this door.

        The air inside the cell is surprisingly fresh, Manning standin at the far end
        of the small cell, looking confused about the three female "visitors".

        She shows him her own bracelet to give him a bit more security about the whole
        situation and her request. While he's it putting, Roldóttir grabs the hands of
        Devi and the Commander, Devi remember this from today's first teleport, searching
        Kaur's face for a nod and as Manning is finished they grab her hands and
        Manning's question
        <em>And what's next?</em>
        fades in the empty cell as they teleport to the moon.
